"""Deterministic verification tool mapping (ISSUE-060).

Maps response tool_name × target_type → verification tool (or None for
non-verifiable actions like create_ticket / notify_security_team).

The mapping is keyed by ``tool_name`` then ``target_type`` so the same
response tool can map to different verification tools for different target
types, even though the current baseline maps one response tool to exactly
one verification tool. Provider manifests may extend this table at runtime
but must pass schema validation before activation.

``update_source_event_disposition`` is excluded — it is a POST_VERIFY
deferred action and is never verified by entity-effect observation tools.
